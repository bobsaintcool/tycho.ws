Hello! Today, I'm proud to announce the release of [Qtile 0.5][1]. A
wildly incomplete changelog is available [here][2]. Qtile 0.5 comes
more than two years after the release of 0.4. There have been many
major improvements and bugfixes by nearly 50 contributors. Many thanks
to everyone who was involved, and long live tiling window managers!
