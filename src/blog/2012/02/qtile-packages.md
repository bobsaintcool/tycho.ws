By not-so-popular demand (:-), I have built some packages for qtile
and its dependencies for 11.10. You can now install my branch of qtile
via:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:tycho-s/ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install qtile

Feel free to e-mail me or [qtile-dev][1] with any feedback!
