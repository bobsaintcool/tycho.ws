Ahoy!

Just writing a quick post to pimp my new [Ampache][1] "bindings",
which are called [ampyche][2], naturally ;-). I slapped them together
one afternoon mostly to get an understanding of the Ampache API, so
that's why I used my native language. I have no specific plans for any
python applications using them, but I'm interested in improving the
stability of Android-based Ampache clients, as well as adding support
for Ampache to Clementine, so I thought this would be a good place to
start.

In any case, I hope someone finds them useful! Happy hacking!
