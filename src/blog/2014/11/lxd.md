Last week at the Openstack Developer Summit I gave a live demo of [migrating a
linux container running
doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9T2gcnQg2k&t=1189), which generated
quite a lot of excitement! Several people asked me for steps on reproducing
the demo, which I have [just
posted](https://github.com/tych0/presentations/blob/master/ods2014.md).

I am one of Canonical's developers working on lxd, and I will be focused on
bringing migration and other features into it. I'm very excited about the
opportunity to work on this project! Stay tuned!
