Unfortunately, the spam on my blog appears to have continued. Thus, I've
implemented an anti-spam procedure in GTFO: the dreaded [CAPTCHA][1]. In the
spirit of the framework, though, I've tried to make it pretty easy... all it
requires is that you type the word 'orange' in to the form. This wouldn't be
enough to fool human attackers, but I believe there's a number of years left in
AI/NLP research before my blog will start being spammed again ;-). Sorry for
the inconvenience, but I don't like logging in every morning to delete the
spam.

In other news, I'm back from the UK. Lots of photos were taken (both by me and
by others), and I'm sure I'll have those up soon.
