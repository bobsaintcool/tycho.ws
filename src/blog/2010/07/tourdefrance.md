The Tour de France started today! As I write this the prologue is
going on (although none of the big names have gone yet, so we don't
know who will lead tomorrow). Google is offering team HTC-Columbia's
stats realtime in the tour via an API, so I may play around with that
a bit (or at least collect the data... I've never looked at pro
riders' stats before).

They also have a good [explanation of power][1], and why it's an
interesting metric. I really have no concept of what my power:weight
ratio is (I've never ridden a bike with a trustable power meter), but
it would be interesting to see what my power:weight was versus a pro.
Some day when I'm rich I'll get a power meter :-)

Anyway, it's going to be an interesting tour. Will Vino ride for
Contador? Will Basso win? Can Lance's monster of a team get a W? Who
knows, but it'll be fun to watch over the next few weeks :)
