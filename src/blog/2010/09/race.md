Uh oh! If you've been browsing this site for the last few days, you've
probably noticed some strange behavior. For some reason I'm getting a
lot more hits than I was when I originally designed the framework, and
it revealed a bug (a [race condition][1], if you're interested). Or at
least, I think that was the bug. I'm not totally convinced that's what
it was, but that's my educated guess.

Anyway, I believe I've fixed the bug, and all should be happy now.
Life is busy, busy, busy now that classes have started. I'm planning
to do a century ride at the end of September, though, so I need to
find time to keep riding :-)
