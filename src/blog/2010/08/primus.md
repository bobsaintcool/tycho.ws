Last night I went to my first (but hopefully not last!) [Primus][1]
show. The show itself was fantastic, Les Claypool is a fantastically
weird and equally awesome bassist. I learned that Les is writing a new
album with Primus to be released in 2011, which is awesome (there's a
Meshuggah album due out then too, it's going to be a great year for
music).

For those who are curious about the title: Primus' slogan is "Primus
Sucks". It came to be when everyone kept commenting on how incredibly
talented Les (and indeed, all the band members were): "hey, you're
really good!".  Eventually, Les started responding with "No, we suck",
and their slogan was born. So, if you're a true Primus fan, you say
"Hey man, Primus sucks!". It was chanted during the encore at the show
last night.

Anyway, I get to cross another band off of my list. Woohoo!
