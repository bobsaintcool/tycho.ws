One of the things I like best about living in downtown Madison is the
[farmer's market][1]. It's very handy to be able to up, walk a few
blocks and get stuff for breakfast, and come home and cook it. If
you're ever in town, I highly recommend dropping by! They have all
kinds of things there including a multitude of Wisconsin cheese :-).
