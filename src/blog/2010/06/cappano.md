This weekend I went up to the observatory deck on the capitol, which
was the first time I'd ever done that. I shot a panoramic with the
camera on my phone. It's not a great camera, but the results turned
out pretty well for a camera phone. If you're interested you can check
out the [original][1] and a [cropped version][2] (warning: these
images are _huge_ -- around 25 MB -- and will probably take a while to
load). Enjoy!

Oh, and the software I used to stitch together the photos was
[hugin][3]. Not exactly an intuitive interface, but it works pretty
well, and it has more buttons and whistles than I could ever want. If
you know something about photo stitching that I don't (which is
highly likely), I'm happy to furnish the originals for a better
attempt.
