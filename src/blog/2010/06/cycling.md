Now that I have this fancy blog, I might as well use it :-).

For my birthday I was given a fancy bike computer (Garmin Edge 705, if you're
interested). I take it on all of my rides, and record them. I publish the
results on [runsaturday.com][1], which is a pretty cool page for managing
things like this. If you're interested in fitness at all, this site has a
plethora of tools which will automatically analyze your fitness for you. It's
very interesting!
