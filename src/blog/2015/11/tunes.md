For a while now I've been kicking around the idea of trying to post one song a
week that I've enjoyed. Mostly as an archival tool for myself, but also
potentially to share with others. I was hoping to write a little bit about why
I like each song as well, but to start out with I'm just going to try to post
one track a week.

Anyway, here's a pretty kickass piano tune. I like piano stuff in minor keys.
