Last week I did this ridiculous thing where I flew around the world in the
easterly direction, giving talks at FOSDEM and linux.conf.au. The linux.conf.au
staff always do a great job of making talk videos, and this year was no
exception.

My talk was on LXD and live migration, a brief history of both as well as a
status update and some discussion of future work on both. There were also lots
of questions in this talk, so there's a lot of discussion of basic migration
questions and inner workings.

Unforatunately, I can't embed it here, so I'll give you a link
instead. Also, keep in mind at the time I was giving this talk I had been up
for ~40 hours, so I forgot some English words here and there :)
