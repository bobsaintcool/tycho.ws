Having sung competitively in several a capella choirs, I've always loved gospel
music. As I was traveling back from South Africa recently, I watched the movie
American Gangster, which has a particularly fantastic arrangement of Amazing
Grace. Unfortunately, I can't find a non-movie version of it (it's uncredited
on the soundtrack), but I'd very much appreciate a link to where to buy it if
someone finds it.
