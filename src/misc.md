### Contact

I can be reached at tycho@FOURIERtycho.ws without the [genius][1]. Disclaimer:
all of my e-mail (right now, anyways) goes through Google's mail servers.

### Work

I currently work for [Canonical][3] on Cloud Stuff. I sometimes do consulting
for friends. I like writing haskell, so if you need your functionals
programmed, I would like to help.

### Play

I ride bikes. I do backcountry and downhill skiing. I live in [Denver,
Colorado, USA][4], where I work out of my tiny downtown apartment and [ride
bikes][5] most days.

### I have friends

I have friends! Unbelievable, I know. Some of them even have [web pages][2].
