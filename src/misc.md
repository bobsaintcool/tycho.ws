### Contact

I can be reached at either tycho@FOURIERtycho.ws or tycho@FOURIERcs.wisc.edu
without the [genius][1]. Disclaimer: all of my e-mail (right now, anyways) goes
through Google's mail servers. I'm also on a few different online communities;
you can find me at [facebook][2], [last.fm][3], and [Slashdot][4]. 

### I have friends

I have friends! Unbelievable, I know. Some of them even have [web pages][5]. 

### Bugs with my page

There may be rendering bugs with my page for a number of reasons. If the page
fails to validate, that's probably why. Send me an e-mail and I'll fix it. If
the page validates correctly, you're probably using a bad browser. A cross
platform browser which will usually render my page correctly is [Firefox][7];
if you're experiencing weird bugs (newlines in strange places, etc.), this will
solve them. 

### What powers this page?

The code is built on top of [web.py][11], and is availible on my
[github][14] page, released under the beerware licence. The CSS
template is one which was adapted from a template found at
[freecsstemplates.org][13].

### Wow this is all really cool!

If something in my ramblings on this page has helped you, that's great! Most of
my code is released under reasonably friendly licences, so you can likely use
it without my explicit written permission. If you're interested in hiring me to
do something new (or you want to motivate me to fix some bug extra fast ;-)
then get in contact with me. My [grad student][12] page has a reasonably
current version of my resume/CV, if you're interested.
