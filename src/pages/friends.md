If you're a friend of mine and you'd like help starting a webpage, or your page
isn't on this list, let me know.

My dad has an <a href="http://dave.tycho.ws/Outdoors">outdoors</a>
page detailing all of his experiences in the wild. Some of the photos
you'll see there are the same ones you'll see in my photo sets, oddly
enough.

My mom has started a recording studio in her home (it's a beautiful
place, too). You can find details about their
equipment/rates/customers etc. on their website: <a

[Tristan Ravitch][1] is a graduate student at UW that I became good
friends with.

[Victoria Richardson][2] is an accountant in the Madison area.

<a href="http://cargocollective.com/vmerch">Valerie Merchant</a> is a
newly minted graphic designer.

<a href="http://net.doit.wisc.edu/~plonka/">Dave Plonka</a> hosted me
when I came to UW-Madison to visit for the prospective graduate
student weekend. We hit it off and he has been a good friend of mine
since I moved to Madison.

<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tdw/">Tyson Williams</a> is a guy I
knew from classes at ISU. When we found out we were both going to
UW-Madison, we decided to be roommates for the first year. It was nice
adjusting with someone that I already knew a bit (although it was
funny, people often confused us and still confuse us, because our
builds and names are so simliar, and we're both from the same place).
