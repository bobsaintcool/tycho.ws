title: People I know on the internet

If you're a friend of mine and you'd like help starting a webpage, or your page
isn't on this list, let me know.

My dad has an [outdoors][3] page detailing all of his experiences in the wild.
Some of the photos you'll see there are the same ones you'll see in my photo
sets, oddly enough.

My mom has started a recording studio in her home (it's a beautiful place,
too). You can find details about their equipment/rates/customers etc. on their
website: [riferecording.com][4]

[Tristan Ravitch][1] is a graduate student at UW that I became good friends
with.

[Victoria Richardson][2] is an accountant in the Madison area.

[Valerie Merchant][5] is a newly minted graphic designer.

[Dave Plonka][6] hosted me when I came to UW-Madison to visit for the
prospective graduate student weekend. We hit it off and he has been a good
friend of mine since I moved to Madison.
