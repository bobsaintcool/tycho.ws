Here's a list of the bands I've seen live, and a list of ones I'm interested in
seeing live. They're listed here **in no particular order**. (N) indicates I've
been to see a band N times. Also, I tend not to list local shows here (or e.g.
any one of the dozens of bands that play at larger festivals I've attended such
as Ozzfest). In general, these are the bands who are on the "[bucket list][2]",
so to speak.
