title: Music
---

While I have a "live performance" section in my hobbies page, music seems to
occupy a large enough fraction of my life that it deserves its own page (hey,
computing has 'useful' and if you know anything about me, you know that I spend
a fair bit of time doing them both ;-). I hope to some day soon to have music
that I've created up here (and indeed, maybe a short writeup of all of the
instruments and groups I've played in and with), but for now it'll simply have
to be my list of bands.

Here's a list of the bands I've seen live. They're listed here **in no
particular order**. (N) indicates I've been to see a band N times. Also, I tend
not to list local shows here. In general, these are the bands who are on the
"[bucket list][2]", so to speak.
