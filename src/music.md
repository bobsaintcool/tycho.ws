Here's a list of the bands I've seen live, and a list of ones I'm interested in
seeing live. (N) indicates I've been to see a band N times. Also, I tend not to
list local shows here (or e.g. any one of the dozens of bands that play at
larger festivals I've attended such as Ozzfest). In general, these are the
bands who are on the "[bucket list][2]", so to speak.
