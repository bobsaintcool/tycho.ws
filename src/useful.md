title=Free Software I've Written
---

Believe it or not, I'm occasionally productive. I am currently a
[graduate student][1], and sometimes I publish papers. I've also
written some software. I have submitted patches to several open source
projects including [python][15] and [Amarok][17], among several
others. I have a [github][14] account where I publish most of my
own projects. In addition to that code, I've written:

*   a php script to do [photo galleries][6]
*   tcrond - a version of cron with [millisecond resolution][7]
*   [todobot][8], an online todo list manager (this is still a work in
    progress... at some point I intend to add an API and write an Android widget
    for it, since I use it on a daily basis).
*   Some code I wrote to sort huge amounts of data (on the order of terabytes)
    on supercomputers (tested on ISU's BlueGene/L) is [here][9].
*   A [script][13] to automatically check Gmail and show the results
    and conky, which also displays notifications using libnotify.
