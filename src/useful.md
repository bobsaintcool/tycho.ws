title: Free Software I've Written
---

Believe it or not, I'm occasionally productive. For a while I was a
[graduate student][1], I published several papers. I am currently the
maintainer of [Qtile][18], a tiling window manager for X written in
python. I have a [github][14] account where I publish most of my own
recent projects:

  * [gvchat][20], an ncurses interface to Google Voice for sending
    SMSes
  * [gtfo][19], the original python framework that powered this blog
  * [hquery][21], an HTML5 tree rewriting engine
  * [haggis][22], a rewrite of gtfo to a static site generator in
    haskell. This is the primary client of hquery, and is still under
    development (however, it powers this blog, so it might work reasonably
    well...).
  * [password][23], a stateless passwowrd manager.
