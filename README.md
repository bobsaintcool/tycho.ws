# tycho.ws

Here is the source code for my web page, [tycho.ws](http://tycho.ws). It also
serves as an example of how to use the blog engine
[haggis](https://github.com/tych0/haggis).

`templates/` contains the five templates that haggis requires to generate your
site. These particular templates are twitter bootstrap based.

`src/` is the page source.
